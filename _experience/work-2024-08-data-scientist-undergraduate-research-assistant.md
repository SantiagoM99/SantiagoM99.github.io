### Key Achievements

* Co-implemented the ETL process (initially in Pandas, later migrated to Polars) to retrieve data from Azure Blob Storage, structure it, and store it in a relational database.
* Developed and conducted integrity tests to ensure the coherence and accuracy of a multidimensional model, validating against the original data.
