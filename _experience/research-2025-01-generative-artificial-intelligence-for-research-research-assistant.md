### Description

* Focused on optimizing university research processes through custom AI agent development and automated evaluation systems.
* Built locally-deployed RAG systems using Ollama models and integrated Gemini API calls to answer domain-specific research questions.
* Designed LLM evaluation architecture to assess response quality and accuracy across different research contexts using Prometheus, BERT score and OpenAI API.
* Automated student assessment processes by developing LLM-based evaluation systems that grade responses against established rubrics and expected answers.
